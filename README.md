# DHLAB
<!-- start dhlab-intro -->

DHLAB is a library of python modules for accessing text and pictures at
the National Library of Norway.

The National Library of Norway (NLN), *Nasjonalbiblioteket* (*NB*) in Norwegian,
has developed an [API](https://api.nb.no/) (Application Programming Interface)
to query the texts in the library's digital archive of books and newspapers,
[NB Digital](https://www.nb.no/search).

[The Digital Humanities lab group](https://www.nb.no/dh-lab/) at the NLN
has developed the dhlab_ library on top of the API, which offers
functionalities for scientists to access the literary archive with python.

The API allows for deeper analysis of the digital texts by generating e.g.
word frequency lists, concordances, collocations, n-grams, as well as
extracting names and narrative graphs.

Analyses can be performed on both a single document, and on a larger corpus.
It is also possible to build one's own corpora based on bibliographic metadata.

without prior programming experience.
