N-gram
: An n-gram is a sequence of linguistic units, typically words or characters.

  Depending on the length n of the 'gram' sequence, we call them unigrams for single tokens, bigrams
  for sequences of two, trigrams for three, etc.

  As we count the occurrences of these n-grams across a large body of text, called a corpus,
  we can view patterns of the rhetoric in that corpus. If we additionally can spread samples of the corpus
  over time, we can see how the use of language develops in that time frame.
