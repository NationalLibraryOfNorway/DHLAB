# Functionality

Analyses can be performed on both a single document, and on a larger corpus.
<!-- start docs-functionality -->

Here are some of the text mining and automatic analyses you can do with `dhlab`:

- Build a [corpus](#dhlab.Corpus) from bibliographic metadata about publications.
- Retrieve word (token) [frequencies](#dhlab.Corpus.count) from a corpus. 
- Fetch [chunks of text](#dhlab.Chunks) (paragraphs) as bag of words from a specific publication.
- Extract [concordances](#dhlab.Concordance)
- [collocations](#dhlab.Collocations)
- Retrieve [n-gram](#dhlab.ngram.nb_ngram) frequencies per yer in a time period.
- Extract occurrences of [named entities](#dhlab.NER).
- Plot narrative graphs of word [dispersions](#dhlab.Dispersion) in a publication.
