Notebooks
==============
The `digital_tekstanalyse`_ repo contains jupyter notebooks (``.ipynb`` files)
with code cells demonstrating example use cases.
These can either be executed `locally on your machine`_ or directly `in the browser`_:


In the browser
---------------------
Either, start an interactive session with `jupyter lab`_ on Binder, without installing anything on
your machine: `Hosted notebooks`_

Or view the contents of the notebooks on our homepage_ (the pages from this link are pre-executed
and non-interactive).


Locally on your machine
---------------------------------
1. Ensure |dhlab_pypi| is :ref:`installed <installation>`.

2. Clone the `digital_tekstanalyse`_ Github repo (from a terminal or command line):

.. code-block:: shell

   git clone git@github.com:NationalLibraryOfNorway/digital_tekstanalyse.git

2. Navigate into the cloned repo and start `jupyter lab`_ from the terminal

.. code-block:: shell

   cd digital_tekstanalyse
   jupyter lab


Once `jupyter lab`_ is up and running, just open any notebook file in the left-hand menu and
follow the instructions to execute the code in the cells.
